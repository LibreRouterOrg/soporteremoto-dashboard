# Remote Support Platform
The goal of this project is to develop a platform to allow Community Networks members to interact with each other, to solve problems that may occur in their network.

# Who can help whom?
Commonly at Community Networks, there are few people with expertise in networking that may have more means to solve technical issues. There are typical situations tough, in which anyone eager to collaborate can be helpful, such as aligning antennas, crimping cables, or simply telling what worked for her or him in the past at solving a similar issue.
Moreover, this platform looks forward to facilitating tools and resources for those who want to learn more about solving networking issues.
Then this platform is intended to be used by every community network member to receive and give support.

# What have we done so far?
We have created a federated ticketing system in which all community members can create, navigate through, and comment tickets.
There is no centralized server, but many little servers, synchronized with each other.

The ticket creation has the option for choosing between the more common issues we have encountered in our communities, as well
as the possibility to create a free text ticket.

At least but not less important, each member can identify itself with a profile pic and a nickname ;)

# What's next?
We have deployed the platform in QuintanaLibre Community Network and will be gathering feedback from the people in the days to come. That feedback will guide our roadmap.
Even though there are some features that we expected will be very helpful and will be added on the next releases.
* Visualizing and monitoring the health of nodes and links.
* The ability to run testing tools on nodes from the user interface itself.
